title: The Javascript ecosystem for Scala.js!
---

Typescript is now used to describe almost all useful Javascript libraries.

This project aims to make all of that useful from Scala.js by converting typescript type definitions automatically in your build.   


## Getting started
The most flexible way of using ScalablyTyped is through the sbt plugin.
