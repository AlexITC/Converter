title: The Javascript ecosystem for Scala.js!
---

Typescript is now used to describe almost all useful Javascript libraries.

This project extends all that work to Scala.js.  

## Getting started
The most flexible way of using ScalablyTyped is through the sbt plugin.

## Derived work
This project took [scala-js-ts-importer](http://github.com/sjrd/scala-js-ts-importer/) as a starting point,
and inherited a lot of decisions from it.
